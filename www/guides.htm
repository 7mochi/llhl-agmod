				<h3>Guide for skinning a HL Model</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						<strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
						The difference between modeling and skinning is very big. Modeling is making 
						your own model with his own morphs and bones etc. The skin is just the outside 
						that you're seeing.<br>
						It's very easy to change only a skin. I'll try to explain how to do it in 6 
						steps.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Step1: Download HL MV</strong><br>
						<br>
						Download the Half-Life Model Viewer from this page:<br>
						<a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/hlmv/index.html">http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/hlmv/index.html</a>
						and install the program.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Step2: Open Model</strong><br>
						<br>
						Open the program and load the model, which needs a new skin (File -> Load 
						Model)
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Step3: Get DM_Base.bmp</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
						Go to the tab Texture in the bottom of your screen. Then you see the flat skin 
						of the model you just chose. Press Export and save the flat bmp-file (most of 
						the time it's called DM_base) to a directory you wish.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Step4: Edit model + teamcolors</strong>
						<br>
						<br>
						Edit the DM_base.bmp in a paint or photo edit program. I always use Jasc Paint 
						Shop Pro for it, cause it also allows you add team colors (Top and bottom 
						color). In JPSP you got a pallet where all the colors got a number; a pallet 
						index. The colors with index 160 - 191 are the top colors and the color with 
						index 192 - 223 are the bottomcolors. The pixels you draw with the colors in 
						that range will be teamcolors.<br>
						(note: The teamcolors only work if the model you used, also got teamcolors. It 
						is possible to make a model without teamcolors to a model with teamcolors, but 
						that's a more difficult job and not easy to explain.)<br>
						To change the colors in the pallet go to: Colors -> Edit Pallet (or use Shift + 
						P)<br>
						For the teamcolors Half-Life uses the HSB-colormodel (Hue, Saturation and 
						Brightness). With the command topcolor or bottomcolor you will only change the 
						Hue and not the Saturation or brightness! It doesn't matter if you use Blue 
						(RGB: 0 0 255) or Red (RGB: 255 0 0), cause when you convert these colors to 
						the HSB-model you got for Blue H:170, S:255, B:128 and for Red H:0, S:255, 
						B:128. The only difference between these colors is the Hue, but that will be 
						changed with the top- and bottomcolor command.
						<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Step5: Preview new skin on model</strong><br>
						<br>
						When you changed the skin and maybe added some nice teamcolors then you can 
						save the DM_base.bmp and go back to the Half-Life Model Viewer.<br>
						Go to the tab Textures again and choose import. Select the DM_base.bmp that you 
						just edited. (note: some models contain more than one skin and if you wanna 
						import an edited skin, be sure that you got the right skin selected or else 
						you'll get an error that the size isn't the same).<br>
						To view the new skin select another tab then Texture.<br>
						If you're not happy with it, you can edit the DM_base again and repeat this 
						step.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>Step6: Save new Model</strong><br>
						<br>
						If you're satisfied with the result you can go back to the texture tab and 
						press the "Save Model" button. Chose the right directory to save it and you can 
						enjoy the game with your new skinned model.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>You are done!</strong><br>

				<h3>EAX Guide</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						Alot of people claim A3D is much better for HL than EAX (besides the distance 
						factor), and after asking why, the answer generally was that they tried eax 
						once, and didnt think much of it. What came as a suprise though, was that did 
						not even tweak their EAX settings and set it up right. Its not much of a 
						suprise then that they didnt think it sounded all that great.<BR>
					<p>
						To let people give it a decent try though, and to allow current users to get 
						the most out their card, heres a short guide to setting it up correctly.<BR>
					<p>
						First, download the latest Liveware from the <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware">
							Soundblaster</a> site (3 is the current version) and install. Once this is 
						done, fire up Audio HQ and your ready to being tweaking.<BR>
					<p>
						<center><IMG src="guides/images/audiohq.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						Next up, click Device Tools and set the max amount of waves playable to 32 as 
						seen in the pic below.<BR>
					<p>
						<center><IMG src="guides/images/wave32.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						Now back in audio hq, open up enviromental audio. Once there, select No Effects 
						from the drop down menu.<BR>
					<P><center><IMG src="guides/images/noeffects.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						Still in enviromental audio, click the source tab to bring up the screen below. 
						Once there, select Wave/Direct sound from the drop down menu and then turn 
						Reverb and and Chorus all the way down to 0% (leave original sound as it was at 
						100%).<BR>
					<p>
						<center><IMG src="guides/images/wave.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						Next, click the options tab in enviromental audio and click the boxes as shown 
						below.<BR>
					<p>
						<center><IMG src="guides/images/save.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						Once this is done, press close and you will be prompted to save your changes, 
						do so as shown below.<BR>
					<p>
						<center><IMG src="guides/images/save2.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						The last change you need to make in windows, is to setup the mixer. Open it up 
						from audiohq, and then tweak the settings similar to the picture below.<BR>
					<p>
						<center><IMG src="guides/images/mixer.gif"></IMG></center>
						<BR>
					<p>
						Note though, that one or two of these are based on my speaker setup, they may 
						sound different on your system (Try to set bass and treble the same as in the 
						picture though, as this will make the sound much clearer and easier to 
						pinpoint). The main one you should test is the front/rear balance. To do this, 
						set it in the middle, the go into a server and then test by standing still and 
						thowing a grenade in front of you and listen to the volume of the explosion. 
						Now do the same again, except as soon as you have thrown the grenade, do a 
						quick 180 degree spin so that you back is facing the the coming explosion. Now 
						if the sound is excatly the same volume as the previous one, then your surround 
						sound is setup right. If is not, go back and try a different setting.
						<BR>
					<p>
						The last thing you need to do, is to edit the settings in your config. Here are 
						the ones i have in mine, although you might want to tweak these so it sounds 
						better for your system (should be fine as they are though):<BR>
						<BR>
						<blockquote>// SOUND SETTINGS<BR>

				<h3>Bunnyjumping</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<B>First Things</B><BR>
					Bunnyhopping in HL is alot harder than in say QW (quakeworld, enhanced netcode 
					version of quake1) where it has become an artform that most the top players use 
					that speeds up the game and also adds a bit more skill to the game. Not only 
					that but its great fun doing it. The reason its harder in HL is because of a 
					bug in the HL engine which causes the player to stick to the floor sometimes 
					when jumping (wether its an actual bug is debateable as Saturn pointed out to 
					me, as its someting todo with the skelatal model system, but either way, it 
					hinders jumping well unlike other games). You can still bunnyhop ok, but 
					nowhere near as good as you could in qw.
					<P>
					Well, i finally found a fix for that thanks to Capcop. The fix is a small alias 
					that replaces your normal jump button, and hammers +jump a few times making it 
					so you no longer stick to the floor.
					<P>
						<blockquote>bind "MOUSE3" "+decentjump"<BR>
							alias +decentjump "+jump; wait; -jump; wait; +jump; wait; -jump; wait; +jump; 
							wait; -jump; wait; +jump; wait; -jump"<BR>
							alias -decentjump "-jump" </blockquote>
					Ive edited a little from his though, as it was causing problems with gauss 
					jumping, but it still works just as well.
					<P>
					Now dont start thinking that just because you have this your automatically 
					going to be able to bunnyhop perfectly. Like i said, all this does is fix the 
					bug in the hl engine to stop you sticking, and thats all. You still need to 
					spend alot of time and practice on mastering the technique, so lets take a look 
					at that.
					<P>
						<b>The Technique</b><BR>
					One of the hardest parts of bunnyhopping is getting the initial speed up and 
					getting some momentum going. To do this you need to learn how to accel jump.
					<P>
					The first thing you do is to start strafing to the left a little, and at the 
					same time, turn your mouse left about 30 degrees. Do this for about 2 seconds 
					(count it while practicing). Next, hit jump, release forward, strafe right and 
					start to turn right ALL at the same time. To get it working best, move your 
					mouse up a bit while turning right,a nd then down a bit as you get to end of 
					your turning, as its better to make a semi circle/arc with your mouse whilst 
					doing doing this.
					<P>
					As you land again, do excatly the same as described above, expect to the left. 
					If your doing it right, you should be making a figure 8 shape with your mouse.
					<P>
					To make learning it a little easier, if have made a small demo which you can 
					watch so that you can easier understand the technique. In it, you will see that 
					i press fire a few times, this is to show you when you need to make the switch 
					(jump, changing strafes, turning etc)
					<P>
						<a href="guides/bunnystart.zip">Starting Jump</a>
					<P>
						For the best way to study it, watch it in slow motion by using this: <b>playdemo 
							bunnystart.dem 0.5</b>
					which wil play it at half speed.
					<P>
						<B>Some Pointers</B><BR>
						Theres a few things you should pay attention to when practicing, such as the 
						fundamental rule that should always release forward on the first jump and <b>never</b>
					press it again during the rest of your jumps. This may seem wierd, but it is 
					the strafes that give you the speed in the air, holding down forward will just 
					slow you down to the server max speed again.
					<P>
					Another mistake a few make, is that you should never move your mouse while you 
					are touching the ground. This is a sure fire way to lose speed.
					<P>
					Once you begin to get it right, you might notice your not picking up as much 
					speed as you like. Well to this, make big sweeping corners/turns as this is 
					where your speed is gained. When doing this though, dont switch strafes or turn 
					the other way, continue turning and strafing the same way as you fly round the 
					corner, only switching and turning the other way when your back on a straight.
					<P>
					Lastly, if your having trouble getting speed up, practice with the gauss and 
					use that the fling you across the map at a decent speed, and then try to 
					carrying on the jumping as you land. You may find this alot easier when trying 
					to find the right technique.
					<P>
					In the end though, its all practice. Its quite a hard skil to learn, and if 
					your serious about wanting todo it, then its going to take you quite a while to 
					get it right. Just keep at it, practicing in an open server or on lan until you 
					find the right feel for it (youll know when you do it right) and youll soon get 
					it.
					<P>

							this demo</a> i recorded and watch the movement closely.

				<h3>Font Editing</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>After my post on AG forum, lot of guys ask me how i do to change fonts ? Then i 
						deceide to do a collums about this topic.</p>
					<p><b>1st Step, changing the color :</b>
					</p>
					<p>It s very easy to change console fonts color. Valve provide us since 1100 patch 
						a cmd for that : con_color "<font color="#FF0000"><b>RRR</b></font> <b><font color="#00FF00">
								GGG</font> <font color="#0000FF">BBB</font></b>". RGB value ( 0 to 255 
						) dertermine ur color.<br>
						<i>Some example :<br>
						</i><font color="#FF0000"><b>Red console</b></font> : type con_color "255 0 0"<br>
						<font color="#00FF00"><b>Green console</b></font> : type con_color " 0 255 0"<br>
						<font color="#0000FF"><b>Blue console</b></font> : type con_color "0 0 255"<br>
						<font color="#FFFF00"><b>Yellow console</b></font> : type con_color "255 255 0"<br>
						<font color="#FF00FF"><b>Pink console</b></font> : type con_color "255 0 255"<br>
						<font color="#00FFFF"><b>Cyan console</b></font> : type con_color "0 255 255"
						<br>
						<br>
						If u wanna black fonts, set all value to 0, if White is needed, fix all value 
						to 255.</p>
					<p><b>2nd Step, changing the fonts :</b>
					</p>
					<p>In last version of HL, console font were bitmap, now valve changed it to True 
						type fonts. The console fonts is also located in fonts.wad file in valve 
						directory. To changing standard Arial fonts in HL u need a little program 
						provided by Valve in the last SDK, called <a href="guides/makefont.zip">Makefont.exe</a></p>
					<p>In a DOS console run it, u will have all parameter needed :<br>
						<br>
						<i><b>[-font "fontname"]</b></i> : Here u need enter the real true type fonts 
						name ( Arial, Tahoma, etc...)<br>
						<b>[<i>-italic] </i></b><i>: </i>Enter this Flag if u wanna Italic font<br>
						<i><b>[-underline]</b> :</i> Enter this Flag if u wanna underlined font<i><br>
							<b>[-bold] </b>: </i>Enter this Flag if u wanna bold font<i><br>
							<b>[-pointsizes sm med lg] </b>: </i>Here u dertermine ur font size<i>. (seem 
							to be bugged )
							<br>
							<b>outfile </b>: </i>output filename ( is needed )</p>
					<p>example : makefont -font "Times New roman" -underline -bold fonts.wad</p>
					<p>Result :
					</p>
					<p><img src="guides/images/fonts.jpg" width="423" height="98"></p>

				<h3>Hud Editing</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					After changing style and color of fonts, i will explain how to edit HUD sprite 
					of HL. This tutotial can also work with other mod.<br>
					</p>
					<p><b>1nd Step, Extracting, Viewing and building sprites:</b>
					</p>
					<p>The easy part of tutorials =). U just need 3 small programs to extract (<b><i>Pak 
								explorer</i></b>), view (<i><b>Sprview.exe</b></i>) and build sprites (<i><b>Sprwiz.exe</b></i>). 
						All can be found on <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/wavelength/">http://www.planethalflife.com/wavelength/</a>.</p>
					<p>1. Run Pak explorer, then extract a sprite ( 640hud7.spr)<br>
						2. Run Sprview and save as 256 BMP file.</p>
					<p><img src="guides/images/sprview.jpg" width="272" height="192"><br>
						3. Edit ur BMP and save as 256 BMP format.<br>
						4. Run Sprwiz, keep all default setting and save ur sprite.</p>
					<p><img src="guides/images/sprwiz.jpg" width="339" height="315"></p>
					<p>Congratulation, u edit ur first Sprite.</p>
					<p><b>2. Color Sprites :</b>
					</p>
					<p>Unfortunetly, coloring sprites have some constraint. U can notice that standard 
						sprite are in grey scale and in game are yellow. It s due to the coders that 
						coded yellow color for sprites in client.dll. So i ve tried to make some HUD 
						color, But only green and red sprites works because of the yellow coded in the 
						client.dll. In other word, u can only do red or green HUD. Other color doesn't 
						work. U can also download my HUD pak at
					</p>
					<p><br>
						<a href="guides/green640HUDpak.zip">green640HUDpak.zip</a><br>
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>Enjoy it.</p>
					<p><b>3nd Step, the Hud.txt:</b>
					</p>
					<p>If u re curios, u have without doubt notice the file <i><b>hud.txt</b></i> in 
						the Valve/sprites dir. Lemme show u the syntax :<br>
					</p>
					<p><b><i>here is an piece of this file :</i></b></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>d_egon 320 320hud1 96 240 32 16<br>
							d_hornet 320 320hud1 144 208 48 16

							item_longjump 640 640hud2 176 96 44 44</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><b><i>Description :</i></b></p>
					<p>The 1st string is the name of the sprite/entities to display ( numbers, item, 
						wepaons, ... )<br>
						The 2nd describe your screen resolution (320, for 320x240 -> 512x384, and 640 
						from 640x480 to higher ).<br>
						Next string, is the file name of the sprite located in sprites dir.<br>
						And the 4 numbers describe a box ( x1,y1,x2,y2) , containing the sprite.</p>
					<p>In other word, if i get this line "<b><i>number_0 640 640hud7 0 0 20 24</i></b>",<i> </i>
						the sprite "number_0" for resolution 640x480+ is in the file <b>640hud7.spr </b>
						contained in the box with this coordinate (0 ,0, 20, 24).</p>
					<p>This <b>hud.txt </b>provide u the ability to make big and detailled sprite.</p>
					<p><b>Conclusion :</b>
					</p>
					<p>With a bit imagination and patience, now can do hud like this :

					<p>Half-Life has the capability to record it's video out to a custom file. You can 
						then process it with a utility from the SDK that saves each frame to a separate 
						.bmp file, and compile it into an .avi with programs like Adobe Premiere or 
						Fast Movie Processor. This is a great way to include footage from the game into 
						a promotional video for your mod. Unfortunately no sound is recorded at all 
						during this. You could try running an audio-capture program while it records 
						video, or plug your audio output into another computer's audio input or into a 
						tape recorder. There really aren't too many options for this. Also, these files 
						can get really big. It's around 70 meg for just 30 seconds of video, although 
						you can make your final .avi reasonably small by compressing it.
					</p>
					<p><b><i>1. Recording Movie</i></b></p>
					<p>Run Half-Life in 320 x 240 and bring down the console. Type<i><b> fps_max </b></i>
						15 or 12. Play your demo with a time scale of 0.1 (<i><b>playdemo demo 0.1</b></i>
						).Type<i><b> startmovie movie</b></i>. This tells it to start recording. I 
						called it movie but you can name it whatever you'd like. Type <i><b>endmovie</b></i>
						to stop recording and quit out of Half-life. Whether you were playing Half-Life 
						or a mod, the movie will always be saved to the Half-Life folder.</p>
					<p><b><i>2. Extracting Movie</i></b></p>
					<p>Drag-n-drop the movie file onto <a href="guides/mkmovie.zip">mkmovie.exe</a>. It 
						will create .bmp files for each frame. It will give them the same name as the 
						movie file, so if you'd like to have a different name, run it with the command 
						line: mkmovie [-basename <.bmp name>]
					</p>
					<p><b><i>3. Building Movie</i></b><movie filename>
					</p>
					<p>Ok, now you got all bitmap of the movie. Run Premiere or Fast Movie Processor ( 
						or other editing/compositing stuff ) import bitmap sequence of your demo. Time 
						strech, add effects, sound, music if needed then make movie ( CTRL + M in Adobe 
						Premiere ). Choose your Video codec ( Cinepak, RLE, DIvX,.... ) and press OK. 
						Don't forget to set frame rate to 15.</p>
					<p>Ok, you can see the result : <a href="http://cccp.altajeux.com/files/ag.avi">ag.avi</a></p>
					<P>
						<B>Update -</B>
					By CHiNX
					<P>
						1. Find the sequence you want within a demo and note the time (use hud_timer 2 
						if its an AG demo)
						<BR>
						2. Bind mouse1 to "startmovie moviename" and mouse2 to endmovie (most keys do 
						not work during demo playback)<BR>
						3. Change fps_max to 15 and then timedemo the demo.<BR>
						4. As soon as you come to the action sequence, hit mouse1 and let it record the 
						movie. Hit mouse2 as soon as its over (dont let it run too long or will take up 
						loads of space).<BR>
						5. Locate the movie file in your hl dir and move it an empty dir on your hdd.<BR>
						6. Put <a href="guides/mkmovie.zip">mkmovie.exe</a> in the same dir as the 
						movie and then create a shortcut of the exe. In the properties, add the movies
