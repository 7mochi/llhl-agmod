AG DMC Version 0.1

Install:
Copy ag_dmc.dll to Half-Life\dmc\ and change from dmc.dll to ag_dmc.dll in Half-Life\dmc\liblist.gam.

Fixes:
cl_fov in teamplay.

New features:
spectate - toggles spectatormode on/off
rcon agstart - respawns all players in server (except those in specmode) + reset score + reset items on the map + reset timelimit.
timeleft - display timeleft

Thats it for now, I'm nog going to do a full blown Adrenaline Gamer mod of it cause of lack of time.
Have fun!
